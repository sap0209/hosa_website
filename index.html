    <h1>Creating Safer, Stronger Communities Together</h1> <p>Emergency preparedness is a key part of community resilience and supports the US Department of Health and Human Services' goal of protecting the public through proactive planning and education. Being prepared goes beyond reacting in the moment—it starts long before an emergency occurs.</p> <p>Skills like performing CPR, recognizing the signs of drowning, practicing fire escape plans, and maintaining working smoke alarms help people act quickly and confidently when every second matters. Preventive care also plays a major role by reducing the risk of severe illness and easing the strain on emergency services through regular screenings, vaccinations, and early detection.</p> <p>Together, these efforts show that preparedness is both an individual and community responsibility. Staying informed, participating in safety training, and keeping up with preventive healthcare all contribute to creating safer, healthier environments. Ultimately, preparedness is about building a strong foundation of awareness and prevention that protects lives and strengthens community resilience for the future.</p>
